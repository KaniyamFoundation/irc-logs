03:09:39 <Gokul> yeah i learned python somehow earlier but i got interested in muthu session so joined and learned from day 1 session .. 
03:09:49 <shrini> Gokul: nice
03:09:57 <shrini> so you are ready for projects
03:10:05 <shrini> do you have any project idea to work on?
03:10:09 <Gokul> yeah i am ready for the projects .. 
03:10:53 <Gokul> web scrapping which you explained in our session i can work on .. 
03:11:26 <shrini> ok Gokul 
03:11:33 <shrini> let me check 
03:12:34 <Gokul> i worked in some analytics for example SAS (statistical analysis) and BIRT (Business intelligence Reporting ) and QLik sense BI - those i worked earlier for project related assignments .. but in python i never tried .. so willing to work and check ..
03:14:50 <Gokul> but above all licensed version which upto your session which is true even client paying more for the license .. so willing to check alternatives .. 
03:15:23 <shrini> oh. SAS is too costly
03:15:37 <shrini> pandas can do all the things
03:15:55 <shrini> we can alternates for most of the commercial software
03:16:03 <shrini> only mideset should be changed
03:17:21 <Gokul> yeah srini SAS is too costly actually for assembly plant (FCA Plant division they used for checking more problematic vins and those related view in Graphical representations we used SAS )
03:17:24 <shrini> Gokul: can you check this https://github.com/KaniyamFoundation/ProjectIdeas/issues/68 ?
