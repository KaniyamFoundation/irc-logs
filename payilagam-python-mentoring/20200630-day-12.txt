02:08:10 <Janet> Yesterday : learned about xml file generation, implemented small example of creating xml file Today's plan :  create a demo of my project and change name in Github. Obstacles : need to information on my project.
02:08:28 <Janet> Project blog:  https://janetpython.wordpress.com/create-a-opds-io-compatable-catalog-for-freetamilebooks-com/
02:09:03 <shrini1> Janet: what information you need?
02:09:17 <Janet> I am not clear with the flow
02:09:46 <Janet> Can you share what is the flow, what are the steps involved in this project
02:10:30 <shrini1> Opds.io is a standard for keeping a book list
02:10:49 <Janet> Ok
02:11:16 <shrini1> Any library software like calibre can read a remote opds  XML file and show the list of books there in a remote website
02:11:41 <shrini1> We run FreeTamilEbooks.com
02:12:06 <shrini1> We have to generate the opds standard XML file for that site
02:12:27 <shrini1> We have a custom XML file
02:12:44 <shrini1> You have learn what is opds standard
02:12:54 <shrini1> And check our XML file
02:13:15 <shrini1> Compare them and ask us for any missing detail for opds standard
02:13:44 <shrini1> Then generate opds  formatted XML file with the details in current XML file
02:13:50 <shrini1> It is a one time task
02:14:13 <Janet> OK.  I will write my understanding in my blog. Correct me if I am wrong
02:14:28 <shrini1> Once it is done, we will ditch the current XML file and couniue to add new book details in opds  format itself
02:14:58 <shrini1> Learn about opds  first
02:15:06 <shrini1> And blog about it
02:15:14 <Janet> OK sure
02:15:26 <shrini1> What are the details we need about any book to add in opds  format
02:15:31 <shrini1> Like this
02:15:44 <shrini1> Then make a XML file manually for 5 books
02:16:10 <shrini1> Then read our XML file and generate opds  XML file automatically
02:16:16 <Janet> Ok
02:16:46 <shrini1> For your previous project make a demo video using screen recording
02:16:51 <Muthuramalingam> My status

02:20:02 <Muthuramalingam> karpagam - you can have linux along with your windows.  Thus you can avoid virus issues.
02:20:19 <karpagam> no
02:20:35 <shrini1> For all, migrate to linux as soon as possible
02:20:58 <karpagam>  linux are avilabli in net?
02:21:00 <shrini1> It will give you tons of powertools to do any programs quickly
02:21:23 <Muthuramalingam> if you still have any important software in windows, search for 'linux mint parallel installation with windows' or 'dual boot linux mint with windows'
02:21:24 <karpagam> ok shrini i will instal the linux
02:21:31 <shrini1> Linuxmint is good to start with
02:21:51 <karpagam> ok muthu and shrini
02:21:56 <Janet> OK I will slowly move to linux
02:21:59 <shrini1> Before installing linux, take backup of all your important data
02:22:18 <karpagam> ok
02:22:40 <Tamil> ya I feel the linux power
02:22:42 <shrini1> On some partition mistake, it will wipe all your harddisk and install linux only
02:22:48 <karpagam> which antivirus software is best ?
02:22:59 <shrini1> Linux is the best antivirus
02:23:10 <shrini1> There is no virus in linux
02:23:12 <karpagam> Tamil: ok tamil
02:23:37 <karpagam> shrini1: Ok shrini
02:23:47 <shrini1> Remember to take backup before installing Linux
02:23:59 <shrini1> There is no recovery software for linux
02:24:07 <karpagam> sure
02:24:16 <shrini1> If some thing is gone, it is gone forever
02:24:19 <Muthuramalingam> if anyone is hesitating to move, I have moved to linux completely few months back.
02:24:36 <Muthuramalingam> It is hardly 1 hour task.
02:24:44 <shrini1> I am using only linux for past 15 years happily
02:25:02 <shrini1> Can do all the things we can do in windows
02:25:13 <shrini1> We have tons of software for all tasks
02:25:19 <Muthuramalingam> can do all the things better than windows.
02:25:53 <Muthuramalingam> Even my kid is enjoying linux games.  In Windows, we always have a fear of virus
