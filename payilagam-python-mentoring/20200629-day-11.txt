02:20:49 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil - your status
02:21:11 <Tamil> yesterday I complete all pdf link in line by line using excel for download pdf file
02:22:01 <Tamil> obstacle is can't read text file in readlines() only read() : https://tamilvelanpython.wordpress.com/2020/06/27/selenium-using-download-all-link-in-text-file/   so i take excel format
02:22:11 <shrini`> Tamil: how many pdf files are there on the site totally?
02:23:24 <Tamil> sorry i can't take totally only take single by single page
02:23:52 <shrini`> you should have all the pdf files in a file
02:23:56 <shrini`> am i right?
02:24:04 <shrini`> a text file or an excel file
02:24:12 <shrini`> count the lines and share here
02:24:31 <Tamil> yes excel file
02:24:44 <shrini`> open it and count the lines
02:24:58 <shrini`> can you share a screenshot of that excel file?
02:25:11 <Tamil> ok
02:25:16 <shrini`> paste here pasteboard.co/ and share the link
02:25:20 <shrini`> along with the count
02:28:34 <Tamil> https://pasteboard.co/Jfgurzr.png
02:29:35 <shrini`> ok
02:29:43 <shrini`> can you paste here the first line
02:29:45 <shrini`> ?
02:30:27 <Tamil> http://www.e-books-chennaimuseum.tn.gov.in/chennaimuseum/index.php?option=com_abook&view=book&id=289
02:30:55 <shrini`> how will you download a book with this link?
02:31:07 <Tamil> Blog is:  https://tamilvelanpython.wordpress.com/2020/06/29/downloading-for-all-pdf-in-government-site/
02:31:58 <shrini`> ok
02:32:01 <shrini`> got it
02:32:15 <shrini`>  how many pdf files you have downloaded totally?
02:32:28 <Tamil> 10
02:32:35 <shrini`> in excel file, we have only 15 lines
02:32:51 <shrini`> how many books are there on the site?
02:32:54 <shrini`> we need all the books
02:33:30 <shrini`> I like the way you explore things and completing the tasks
02:33:38 <shrini`> but keep the things simple
02:33:51 <shrini`> Do the following
02:34:31 <shrini`> 1. scrap that site using scrapy or selenium and get all the PDF links
02:34:49 <shrini`> 2. write down all the links for pdf to a text file
02:35:12 <shrini`> Now, we should have a text file with X number of pdf file links
02:35:28 <shrini`> 3. now, read the text file line by line and download the pdf file
02:35:59 <shrini`> 4. once all the pdf files are downloaded, write another program or use "ia" command to upload them all to archive.org
02:36:37 <shrini`> the project is to complete all the steps one by one
02:37:11 <Tamil> I can't read text file in readlines() link can't taken
02:37:41 <Tamil> can I use excel file
02:37:47 <shrini`> Tamil: do that as a seperate small program, to read and write text files
02:37:53 <shrini`> dont use excel file for now
02:38:01 <shrini`> that will add more complexities
02:38:16 <Tamil> little
02:38:17 <shrini`> and you should know how to read and write files
02:38:42 <shrini`> check here - http://www.e-books-chennaimuseum.tn.gov.in/chennaimuseum/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=144
02:39:25 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil - you can focus on step #1 - scrapping and getting all PDF links first.  It is not yet done, right?
02:39:44 <Tamil> yes
02:39:45 <shrini`> Tamil: total 264 books are there
02:40:13 <shrini`> Tamil: get all the direct links for the 264 pdf files and write them to text file
02:40:16 <Muthuramalingam> then, you can start thinking about placing those pdf links in text file.
02:40:43 <shrini`> In the screenshot you sent, you store main links for the books
02:41:01 <shrini`> then you use selenium to open that link and get the pdf file link
02:41:18 <Tamil> yes correct
02:41:38 <shrini`> on that phase, instead of downloading the file, just write the file URL in a text fike
02:41:40 <shrini`> file
02:41:54 <shrini`> we need links for all 264 pdf files
02:42:04 <shrini`> Tamil: is it okey?
02:42:36 <shrini`> Tamil: I know you would complete the project by some way
02:43:04 <shrini`> but, going the above mentioned way, will help you split your future projects on the same way
02:43:17 <shrini`> it will help a lot in future
02:43:43 <Tamil> ok i will take all pdf file in text file and line by line.
02:43:50 <Muthuramalingam> yes, Tamil - complete your project module by module by having above steps. Thus, you can easily complete.
02:44:14 <Muthuramalingam> Note down shrini's steps.  Complete one by one.
02:44:39 <shrini`> Tamil: dont think that we are not letting you to complete the project
02:44:52 <shrini`> Tamil: you are doing awesome works
02:44:53 <Tamil> I have a doubt, can i take manually pdf link
02:45:02 <Tamil> thank you
02:45:12 <shrini`> going extra miles to progress further
02:45:19 <shrini`> ahahaha
02:45:28 <shrini`> Tamil: no manual work here
02:45:30 <Tamil> of course
02:45:51 <shrini`> getting the pdf file links is the major work here
02:46:14 <shrini`> you have already found all the things for the next steps like, downlading files
02:46:19 <shrini`> and uploading to archive.org
02:46:33 <shrini`> now, focus on scrapping the site
02:46:43 <shrini`> learn scrapy if required
02:46:50 <Tamil> ya but is little difficult for getting all pdf file in whole website
02:47:07 <shrini`> Tamil: it can be difficult
02:47:26 <shrini`> but that is what web scrapping is
02:47:44 <shrini`> browing the website automatically, we a human do is web scrapping
02:47:45 <Tamil> extract all data
02:47:54 <shrini`> it will give great learnings
02:48:00 <shrini`> give scrapy a try
02:48:15 <Tamil> ok I will try.
02:48:21 <shrini`> ok
02:48:38 <Muthuramalingam> By the way, shrini and all - We planned for two weeks mentoring till June 30th.  and it is tomorrow.
02:48:59 <Tamil> oh

02:52:06 <karpagam> B.E completed , but not working
02:52:07 <Tamil> Me too take project and learn more
02:52:30 <Janet> Working as web developer
02:53:07 <miranda17> Gud morning all,I am not a student or job seeker .out of my interest i learnt python.Just to know some basics about python and help my students in doing projects in final year.
02:55:12 <Janet> Suggest us few more projects to learn more
02:55:21 <Tamil> I am working for Repair Engineer till now. lockdown time is useful for learn python. but it is very interesting to learn more.
02:55:46 <shrini`> good to know about all
02:56:31 <shrini`> Muthuramalingam: share your thoughts
02:58:27 <shrini`> fine
02:58:37 <shrini`> let us continue on this week
02:58:52 <shrini`> or till you complete the taken project
02:59:07 <Tamil> Thank you shrini
02:59:10 <shrini`> Janet: can you explore this issue
02:59:12 <shrini`> https://github.com/KaniyamFoundation/ProjectIdeas/issues/68
02:59:21 <shrini`> already taken by Gokul
02:59:27 <shrini`> but he is too busy
02:59:35 <miranda17> Thank you Shrini.
02:59:40 <shrini`> he may not have time to finish it
02:59:59 <Janet> OK shrini
03:00:19 <Janet> I will go through this issue
03:00:23 <shrini`> Janet: what is the languge you use for your works?
03:00:47 <Janet> Php
03:00:59 <shrini`> any framework?
03:01:23 <Janet> No frameworks
03:01:51 <shrini`> ok
03:02:03 <shrini`> then I hope you will enjoy learning python and flask
03:02:08 <Janet> Tell me what to Learn. I will learn
03:02:44 <shrini`> rest API, flask - these will help you develop backend stuff for any project
03:02:56 <Janet> OK.
03:03:07 <shrini`> Django is a full big framework to build web applications quickly
03:03:26 <shrini`> RabbitMQ is a queue manager
03:03:32 <Janet> Shall I learn Django along with python
03:03:46 <shrini`> redis or rq also will help to manage queues
03:03:48 <shrini`> yes
03:03:55 <shrini`> django will help a lot
03:04:04 <Janet> OK shrini
03:04:15 <shrini`> but before going to django, build few command line applications in python
03:04:26 <Janet> OK sure
03:04:29 <shrini`> the real power of python comes with command line only
03:04:46 <shrini`> for the opds.io project, build as a command line tool
03:05:02 <shrini`> then you can learn django
03:05:04 <Janet> Now suggest command line project
03:05:41 <Janet> I will work on that now
03:05:47 <shrini`> I shared project idea about opds.io
03:05:55 <shrini`> Janet:https://github.com/KaniyamFoundation/ProjectIdeas/issues/68
03:06:06 <Janet> OK shrini
03:06:07 <shrini`> build this as a command line too
03:06:15 <Janet> Sure
03:06:20 <shrini`> on the same issue, write a comment that you are working on that
03:06:29 <shrini`> so that others wont work on it
03:06:42 <Janet> OK shrini
03:07:26 <shrini`> okey all. see you tomorrow
03:07:37 <Janet> Thank you all
03:07:45 <karpagam> Thank you all
03:08:00 <miranda17> Thank You all
03:08:09 <shrini`> come up with  a plan how we have to help you after the mentoring period (from next week)
03:08:26 <shrini`> so that we can explore more
03:08:51 <karpagam> ok sure.
