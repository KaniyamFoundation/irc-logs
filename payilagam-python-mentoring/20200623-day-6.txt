I m not satisfy information about mechaniza. so i can't write program about using mechaniza.

02:35:12 <shrini1> I see karpagam execute python in IDLE itself
02:35:18 <shrini1> Don't run that way
02:35:26 <shrini1> Open command prompt
02:35:40 <shrini1> Run as python3 name.py
02:35:54 <karpagam> i am adding the path where its available.. can you see the demo.. na innum athula ethavathu add pannumah?
02:37:11 <karpagam> shrini1 : ok shrini
02:37:59 <Tamil> blog: https://tamilvelanpython.wordpress.com/2020/06/23/beautiful-soup-library/
02:38:16 <Tamil> yesterdat I did't write github.
02:41:03 <shrini1> karpagam: I am yet to see the full video
02:41:19 <shrini1> Will see today and update on telegram
02:41:46 <Tamil> On my blog is any mistake or i write wrong information please comment it. otherwise i do know the mistake.
02:42:36 <Miranda> I learnt about Git, Github and Gist.github ,but I am not able to get a clear idea about this three...Can you explain me shrini?
02:43:13 <Muthuramalingam4> Sorry, my internet got disconnected in between
02:43:22 <shrini1> Git is source code version management system
02:43:45 <shrini1> Github is a common place to host the repos
02:44:45 <Miranda> Git :To maintain the version control.. Github: To hold our full version of our project is it correct shrini
02:45:36 <Muthuramalingam4> I missed the topics in between.  For Miranda - If we give a folder name, will your program update text in all jpeg files present there.  If not, you can add. 
02:46:10 <shrini1> Github is to share our git repositories to the world, so that anyone can clone and use them
02:46:31 <shrini1> If we keep the git folders ourself, how can we share with the world?
02:46:49 <shrini1> We need a place to put them
02:46:49 <Miranda> Ok shrini..
02:47:00 <shrini1> We can share via google drive
02:47:15 <shrini1> But github is advanced one with many features
02:47:37 <shrini1> Like issues, wiki, releases, role based access control etc
02:47:49 <shrini1> Like github, we have many sites
02:48:01 <Miranda> Ok shrini..gist.github?
02:48:04 <shrini1> Gitlab, gittea, phabricator etc
02:48:30 <shrini1> Gist is just to paste a small code snippet to share to world quickly
02:48:31 <Miranda> Ok shrini
02:48:50 <shrini1> It is just like a pastebin site
02:49:05 <Miranda> Ok Shrini..
02:49:15 <Miranda> No ..Now I tired with only one Photo...
02:49:19 <Miranda> muthu
02:52:03 <Muthuramalingam4> Miranda, ok - read folder, add text for all photos in that folder.  add this.  later you can use flickrapi
02:52:17 <Miranda> Ok muthu..
02:52:37 <shrini1> Ask the resolution for the images from user
02:52:50 <shrini1> Resize all the images based on the user input
02:53:07 <Miranda> Ok shrini..I will try..
02:53:39 <sakthi> shirini pal pandi is my friend he not have time to  do a project because of personal commit.what idea will given to him
02:53:59 <Muthuramalingam4> shrini1 Janet - I missed points in between.  Janet - your obstacle discussed? I missed karpagam answer also for my question.  If already discussed, leave those
02:54:15 <Janet>  Not yet
02:55:01 <shrini1> You can read all the logs here
02:55:12 <Muthuramalingam4> sakthi - if he does not have enough time.  you can ask him to replicate your project and learn.  You can guide him where he struggles. 
02:55:55 <sakthi> ok muthu
02:56:00 <Janet> current_date = date.today()return render_template(“view_user.html”,rows = rows, now_date = current_date).
02:56:23 <Janet> Here I am passing current date, which gives output in template file
02:56:45 <Janet> {% set age = now_date – row[“dob”] %}
02:57:09 <Janet> Set a variable called age and finding the difference of days
02:57:30 <shrini1> Check the topic Muthuramalingam4 
02:57:50 <Janet> Error: unsupported operand type for :- datetime. Date and str
02:58:07 <Muthuramalingam4> Janet - did you search answer in internet?
02:58:12 <Janet> Can anyone suggest me how to search this type of issue in google
02:58:24 <Muthuramalingam4> link shrini1
02:58:37 <shrini1> Check topic on top
02:58:44 <Muthuramalingam4> found
02:58:51 <shrini1> https://freenode.logbot.info/kaniyam
02:59:04 <shrini1> All the chats are stored here at live
02:59:08 <Janet> It gives finding date in python only, not able to find the fix for flask template file
02:59:27 <Muthuramalingam4> got, live update - I didn't know this.  good place to get. 
03:00:13 <shrini1> Janet: separate that task as a pure python code
03:00:27 <shrini1> Do the calculation on python 
03:00:35 <Muthuramalingam4> Janet - it is not flask specific. Check what you are returning.  Add your logic and return the value.  
03:00:36 <shrini1> And display as flask variable
03:00:41 <Muthuramalingam4> yes
03:00:49 <Janet> OK. I will try
03:01:02 <shrini1> Make the entire date calculation in another small python file
03:01:13 <shrini1> Then use it in your project
03:01:32 <Janet> OK thanks for this idea
03:01:36 <karpagam> Today's plan  :i used command prompt  to write code and run it in python 3 name.py
03:02:14 <karpagam> and then i will upload a new demo video
03:03:06 <Miranda> I have class...Shall I leave Shrini and Muthu?
03:04:12 <Muthuramalingam4> yes sure.  thanks Miranda
03:04:18 <Miranda> Thank You Shrini and Muthu...
03:04:34 <Muthuramalingam4> whoever is done with their status and discussions can leave.  
03:04:56 <Janet> Thank u all
03:06:08 <karpagam> Thank you all
03:07:07 <Muthuramalingam4> shrini1 I will install anydesk and connect you for tamil typing
