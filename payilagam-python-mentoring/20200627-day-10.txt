02:13:38 <Muthuramalingam> the same time (3 PM) every saturday.  Thats why I couldnt attend linux meet today.  
02:14:01 <Muthuramalingam> Obstacle: I couldn't set slug in wordpress yesterday.  Today I will check that.  
02:15:16 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil - your status
02:15:38 <Tamil> Yesterday I did selenium using download all link in text file.
02:16:03 <Tamil> today open a text file and line by line link execute and download the book.
02:16:44 <Tamil> obstracle is: open a single link in text file is working well. but set of link is not working how to clear this. And how open link in line by line I tried but i can't, I write blog in detail.
02:16:57 <Tamil> Blog: https://tamilvelanpython.wordpress.com/2020/06/27/selenium-using-download-all-link-in-text-file/
02:17:17 <Tamil> Github: https://gist.github.com/tamilvelan7/9e90cc36a54904987570fd2fa232e8d2
02:17:22 <shrini> Tamil: did you add all the PDF links in that file?
02:17:34 <shrini> how many PDF files are there in total?
02:18:20 <Tamil> there is no pdf file in upto download page.
02:19:29 <shrini> Tamil: first, get all the PDF links from that site and write in a text file
02:19:36 <Tamil> Each link have a each pdf file
02:19:47 <shrini> in that text file, we need all the links for all the pdf files on that site
02:19:49 <shrini> yes
02:19:53 <shrini> is this done?
02:20:21 <shrini> use selenium to goto all the pages, click the required links and get the download link for the pdf files
02:20:29 <shrini> is this done?
02:21:02 <Tamil> No
02:21:56 <shrini> collect all the links first
02:22:05 <shrini> use scrapy or selenium 
02:22:14 <shrini> to get the pdf file links
02:22:34 <shrini> what is the current content of your text file now?
02:23:28 <Tamil> page 2-A-Z link in text file 
02:25:17 <shrini> we dont want all the links on that page
02:25:23 <shrini> we need only pdf files
02:25:35 <shrini> we currently donw know how many pdf files are there on the site
02:25:56 <shrini> traverse the site with selenium and get only pdf file links and store on the text files
02:26:16 <shrini> then read that file line by line using readlines()
02:26:23 <shrini> then download each file locally
02:26:36 <shrini> then upload these files to archive.org
02:26:46 <shrini> this is the flow 
02:26:51 <shrini> is this fine Tamil ?
02:27:05 <Tamil> ok
02:28:30 <shrini> thanks
02:29:18 <shrini> For all, did anyone talk to our missing friends?
02:29:30 <Janet> According to myself, time is not an issue, in python class we had many people in this time only, but in project mentoring section the count is keep on decreasing, main thing they may hesitate to say I didn't do anything today. Next not that much effort clear their issues by using Google. Bcz most of the time we generally depend on others, we think
02:29:31 <Janet> person only clear our issues, they may try Google, but can't get immediate result. Bcz next day mentoring section they want to show only result. Not their attempts. I took 4 days to find the resize result. Getting immediate result is impossible. Keep on trying then we get result according to our hard work.  Afraid to ask doubts in mentoring
02:29:31 <Janet> section. These all the reasons as per my thoughts. 
02:30:24 <shrini> good points Janet 
02:30:27 <shrini> thanks
02:30:59 <Janet> Many of them very interactive in python session
02:31:12 <shrini> we need to know the progress only
02:31:16 <shrini> not the results
02:31:34 <Janet> Yes, I understood that
02:31:38 <shrini> we should inform this on next mentoring sessions
02:32:02 <Janet> OK shrini
02:32:06 <shrini> all these mentoring is just to remove the dependancy of others to do any project
02:32:26 <shrini> we are trying to do all the works by the students only
02:32:49 <shrini> we have chennaipy mailing list to ask questions
02:33:18 <shrini> it is completely ok to say that "I did nothing yesterday"
02:33:45 <shrini> tell these to friends and ask them to join the irc meet
02:33:57 <Janet> Yes. Can you please share example question posted by Tamil and their response in telegram
02:33:57 <shrini> is there any issue with the IRC meet format?
02:34:46 <karpagam> shrini: nop
02:34:50 <shrini> Janet: Tamil Muthuramalingam karpagam share your thoughts on the IRC meet format
02:35:13 <shrini> do we have to switch to any video/voice chat for the standup meets?
02:35:20 <Tamil> No issue
02:35:32 <Janet> Actually they may feel pushing them to work hard without helping
02:36:04 <Janet> This what I think
02:37:01 <karpagam> actually it was a good idea
02:37:17 <shrini> hmmm
02:37:29 <shrini> Janet: got it
02:37:33 <miranda40> According to my point of view. I think many students are struggling to work in the daily basis. as they all are beginners in python.
02:37:36 <shrini> Janet: how can we improve it?
02:37:49 <Janet> You all ready to help, but the missing people should speak, so only we can guide them
02:38:27 <Janet> In telegram all may notice your message, still they are not replying
02:38:34 <shrini> miranda40: working daily on python only get some confident and expereience
02:38:45 <shrini> hmmm
02:38:54 <shrini> link to get feedback from them
02:39:06 <shrini> and improve ourself on next mentoring sessions
02:39:24 <miranda40> Many people are in job and working in python .so i think its difficult for them. 
02:39:26 <shrini> is it possible for any of you to talk to them and get the resons for them to miss
02:39:38 <shrini> ?
02:39:49 <Janet> Is is possible to send private message to all, so that they should reply right
02:39:55 <shrini> yes miranda40 that may be a reason
02:40:20 <shrini> Janet: can you ping them in private message?
02:40:26 <shrini> or Muthuramalingam ?
02:40:37 <shrini> Muthuramalingam: they may answer in pvt message
02:40:59 <Janet> OK shrini, if Muthu send message they will reply
02:41:41 <shrini> based on their feedback, we can make changes on the mentoring format 
02:41:51 <Janet> Ok
02:41:57 <miranda40> Work pressure is more during this covid period . I think instead of daily updates .we can have updates weekly twice.Becoz many are pressurized. its my suggestion.
02:42:13 <shrini> now, need your feedback is required
02:42:27 <shrini> Janet: miranda40 karpagam Tamil Muthuramalingam 
02:42:45 <shrini> what do you feel on this mentoring program, after the online course
02:42:48 <shrini> ?
02:42:54 <shrini> are we doing good?
02:43:05 <shrini> what are the dofficulties you face?
02:43:18 <shrini> what are the changes we need on this mentoring program?
02:43:23 <shrini> is 15 days is fine?
02:43:28 <Muthuramalingam> shrini - We conducted survey on IRC meet.  The results are good.  Nobody says issues.  
02:43:29 <Janet> For me it's improving my skills, I keep on spending time to share something regarding python here
02:43:32 <shrini> is daily standup is fine?
02:43:53 <shrini> is blogging helping you?
02:44:11 <shrini> ok Muthuramalingam 
02:44:42 <shrini> miranda40: yes. In this covid time, every one have too much pressure
02:44:46 <Janet> It's fine, when we are in wrong flow, u people correcting us
02:45:44 <karpagam> fine shrini , there is no difficulties i face
02:45:46 <miranda40> Sure I have improved a lot. But I have two kids and they are going for online classes. Then college work. Laptop is not free. daily i ll sleep only by 12.30 and get up by 5.30.now i am getting heath issues.
02:46:26 <shrini> oh sorry miranda40 
02:46:41 <shrini> take care of health
02:46:54 <shrini> that should be the first priority
02:47:04 <miranda40> Ok sure. Thank you.
02:47:09 <shrini> you can read our chatlogs any day
02:47:18 <shrini> so get some more sleep from tomorrow
02:47:40 <shrini> skip the project for now
02:47:56 <Muthuramalingam> The feedback on IRC are: 
02:47:57 <Muthuramalingam> We get a chance to share about our project, from that we get guidance for travel in a right way of the project. Obstacles are discussed which is very useful to think in a different way
02:48:16 <shrini> ok Muthuramalingam 
02:48:17 <miranda40> Ok shrini.Thank you for your suggestion.
02:48:29 <Muthuramalingam> /This is my first experience and my first online class for payilagam. I did't expect this I learn more about python it is very useful for me and others. I am working for a electronic field so I don't know anything related program. last 2 months is very useful for over the course of a lifetime. IRC is very useful for me Thanks for Shrini and
02:48:30 <Muthuramalingam> Muthu.//
02:48:30 <miranda40> Ok muthu.
02:48:59 <Muthuramalingam> /It's good interaction between you and me there is no issue I think so//
02:49:13 <Muthuramalingam> I did not notice any negative updates there.  
02:49:30 <shrini> Muthuramalingam: ok
02:50:21 <Muthuramalingam> IRC chat is a good option for mentoring.  Whoever attended here are (though with initial struggles) - should be confident enough to discuss technical things with anyone in the world.  They can tell their issues. 
02:50:40 <shrini> :-)
02:50:47 <Janet> Yes correct 
02:50:50 <miranda40> Class point of view there is no issues muthu. It was excellent.But for project we have to work more and learn.Because as of my view if i am searching anything in google it kills more time.
02:51:05 <shrini> yes miranda40 
02:51:16 <shrini> that is the reason for the mentoring program
02:51:25 <shrini> the more you search, the more you learn
02:51:34 <shrini> we can learn anything by doing only
02:51:54 <miranda40> S that I experienced but time is very less shrini for working people.
02:51:55 <shrini> we have spent 30 hours of watching videos by Muthuramalingam 
02:52:13 <shrini> miranda40: understood
02:52:25 <Muthuramalingam> miranda - it is not all about completing the project.  It is all about how much you learnt in these days.  These learnings will be useful for your life time.  
02:52:52 <shrini> yes. completing project is not the goal here
02:53:01 <miranda40> S I agree Shrini and muthu.
02:53:01 <shrini> the progress is the learning
02:53:19 <shrini> learning to search
02:53:29 <shrini> learning to ask in a public mailing list
02:53:31 <Muthuramalingam> we all are beginners in python.  Nobody will expect project completion. Everyone wants to know how much freely you tried.  
02:53:35 <shrini> learning to write blog
02:53:55 <shrini> learning to give progress update on standup meet
02:54:06 <Muthuramalingam> positive things I feel is - writing blogs.  Writing blog is gradually changing ourselves.  
02:54:10 <shrini> this should be the result of the mentoring
02:55:22 <Muthuramalingam> Most people who did not attend IRC are already not writing blogs, though I insisted in most of the python classes.  
02:55:26 <miranda40> Ok shrini. S muthu great change in my life before covid and after covid.
02:55:32 <Muthuramalingam> :)  
02:56:08 <miranda40> I learnt more. Till day before yesterday I updated my blog and I was working hard.
02:56:16 <Muthuramalingam> It is their call to get changed.  
02:57:13 <shrini> we should add few relazations for the working people Muthuramalingam for next events
02:57:43 <shrini> hope they will give some breathing time for working people
02:58:06 <Muthuramalingam> shrini - yes, for next event - during the initial days itself, we shall ask everyone's schedule.  Based on that, we can have teams.  
02:58:10 <shrini> may be like - blog post once in a week, can miss standups, etc
02:58:29 <shrini> right, splititng by teams also will help
02:58:44 <shrini> full time students, job seekers, working people
02:58:46 <miranda40> S that's good idea shrini.
02:58:49 <Muthuramalingam> yes
02:59:17 <shrini> thanks miranda40 for bringing these points
02:59:21 <Muthuramalingam> only by now, I came to know miranda40's tough schedule.  :(
02:59:33 <shrini> its our fault
02:59:36 <shrini> sorry for this
02:59:38 <Muthuramalingam> yes shrini
02:59:56 <shrini> let us plan better on next time
03:00:04 <Muthuramalingam> sure
03:01:54 <shrini> thanks all
03:02:20 <karpagam> thank you shrini  and muthu
03:02:35 <Tamil> Today is good conversation for all.
03:02:40 <Tamil> thank you all
03:04:30 <miranda40> Thank Shrini and muthu. 
03:04:37 <miranda40> Thanks
