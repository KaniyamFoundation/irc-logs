02:13:20 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil1 Did you complete the remaining parts - removing hardcode links from your code?  
02:13:53 <Muthuramalingam> Janet - what is your obstacle.
02:14:55 <shrini1> Janet if your application is for the user profile web application, then no need of CLI
02:15:23 <shrini1> Yesterday I told for the project of image resize, upload to flicker application
02:15:30 <Tamil1> yes,  hardcode links means?
02:15:40 <shrini1> You proceed with your original plans Janet21 
02:16:20 <shrini1> Tamil1: don't add any absolute path in code
02:16:36 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil1: mentioning the links directly in your code. 
02:16:59 <shrini1> Your code won't run on my computer, as the headcode directory won't be there in my computer
02:17:37 <shrini1> Tamil1: if you know selenium, use that to browse the govt website, and get all the PDF links in a text file
02:18:07 <Tamil1> Ok I will try selenium.
02:19:01 <Muthuramalingam> any other questions we have to discuss? 
02:19:41 <miranda> glob.glob("D:/aPython/IRCProjectmiranda/[0-9]*.txt")
02:20:02 <miranda> one obstacle i faced .when I run in command prompt its working.But if i run in an IDLE program .output is not coming sir.just a empty space is coming
02:20:18 <shrini1> Tamil1: check the replies from chennaipy 
02:20:49 <shrini1> IDLE is for quick testing only
02:21:10 <shrini1> miranda: edit code in a text editor and run in command prompt
02:21:21 <shrini1> That is the way to go
02:21:36 <shrini1> IDLE is for running quick code snippet
02:21:39 <Tamil1> chennaipy-request mail recevied.
02:22:02 <miranda> Shrini for some programs I am getting the output . Is this a wrong way?
02:22:37 <shrini1> It is not wrong
02:22:52 <shrini1> But don't develop your programs in IDLE
02:22:53 <Muthuramalingam> miranda: IDLE will not work properly some times for big programs.  Dont work on IDLE, command prompt is good to go. 
02:23:26 <miranda> Then y its not running.i wrote only single line code
02:25:00 <shrini1> It should run
02:25:08 <shrini1> What is your code?
02:25:11 <shrini1> Share here
02:25:32 <miranda> import glob 
02:25:40 <miranda> sry shrini
02:25:55 <miranda> glob.glob(" ")
02:27:19 <Muthuramalingam> What is the expected output here.  What is the actual output you are getting?
02:28:10 <miranda> expected output from the imagefolder it should display all the files
02:28:35 <miranda> but I am getting empty space 
02:29:02 <miranda> but if I run without IDLE its working
02:29:09 <shrini1> glob.glob(*)
02:29:24 <miranda> I have shown in my blog
02:29:35 <shrini1> all_files=glob.glob(*)
02:29:51 <shrini1> print(all_files)
02:29:58 <shrini1> This should work
02:30:22 <miranda> ok I ll try.
02:30:55 <miranda> In notepad++ after saving I am running my code. where I ll c my output?
02:31:17 <shrini1> How do you run the code?
02:31:37 <miranda> I pressed f5.Just a command prompt flashes and closed
02:31:54 <shrini1> Open command prompt
02:32:11 <shrini1> goto the directory where the code is
02:32:22 <shrini1> cd directry
02:32:26 <shrini1> Then
02:32:37 <shrini1> python3 filename.py
02:32:54 <miranda> S this I tired its working. but is this the procedure?
02:33:35 <Muthuramalingam> command line execution - using command prompt
02:33:46 <Muthuramalingam> notepad++ is also another editor like IDLE
02:34:00 <Muthuramalingam> welcome karpagam

02:41:44 <Muthuramalingam> today's plan?
02:41:55 <shrini1> karpagam: how you are running the program?
02:42:19 <karpagam> i know indexerror means access an index that is outside the bound of a list. but here sys.argv[1] is they only way to access a comand line?
02:42:33 <karpagam> command prompt
02:42:56 <shrini1> How you are going to give input?
02:43:12 <karpagam> my todays plan is clear the error, i konw when i clear the error my program is working perfectly
02:43:23 <karpagam> idle 
02:43:37 <shrini1> How you get the input from user?
02:43:45 <karpagam> i saved the idle programs on script names
02:44:08 <shrini1> Then?
02:44:56 <karpagam> after run the cmd like py( check_script.py)
02:45:07 <karpagam> here check_script is a file name
02:45:44 <karpagam> sorry   py check_script.py --> this is correct
02:46:10 <shrini1> What is mean by command line argument?
02:46:40 <shrini1> What is sys.argv[1] ?
02:47:25 <miranda> input parameter is passed to the script.
02:47:48 <karpagam> Command Line Argument is information passed to the program when you run the program
02:48:02 <karpagam> sys.argv[1]
02:48:30 <karpagam> is used to represents the first cammand lline programs
02:48:46 <karpagam> cammand line argument*
02:49:16 <shrini1> karpagam: ?
02:49:21 <karpagam> yeah
02:49:38 <shrini1> How to give a command line argument?
02:49:49 <shrini1> karpagam: ?
02:51:09 <karpagam> when you calling sys.argv[1]
02:51:55 <shrini1> How to give a command line argument?
02:52:06 <shrini1> Search and show a sample here
02:52:17 <karpagam> ok 
02:53:04 <karpagam> import sys
02:54:49 <karpagam> import sys
02:54:53 <karpagam> ('Fourth argument:',  str(sys.argv[3]))
02:57:26 <karpagam> what happens. i am wrong
02:57:29 <shrini1> Not this
02:57:45 <shrini1> You have to give the argument not in the code
02:57:59 <shrini1> You have to give argument while running the code
02:58:23 <karpagam> ok shrini
02:58:28 <shrini1> Python code.py argument1 argument2 argument3
02:58:47 <shrini1> You have to give like this while running code.py
02:59:22 <karpagam> ok shrini
03:01:59 <miranda> import glob 
03:02:08 <miranda> print(glob.glob("apython/*"))
03:02:21 <miranda> D:\aPython>python3 globmeth1.py
03:02:30 <shrini1> Ok
03:02:31 <miranda> []
03:02:54 <shrini1> Do you have a folder apython in the folder where you have the code?
03:03:03 <shrini1> Oh
03:03:13 <shrini1> You are already inside that folder
03:03:28 <miranda> in apython i am having my file
03:03:29 <shrini1> Just run dir command
03:03:50 <miranda> got the files and directoreis.
03:04:20 <shrini1> Try giving full path inside glob
03:04:36 <shrini1> Then change to relative path
03:04:45 <shrini1> On the dir outout
03:05:03 <shrini1> Do you see a folder named 'apython'?
03:05:15 <miranda> ok shrini.now i am getting.
03:05:23 <shrini1> Just give *
03:05:29 <shrini1> Instead of path
