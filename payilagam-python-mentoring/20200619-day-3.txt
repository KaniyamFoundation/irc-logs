02:18:59 <Miranda>  plan to resize images, learn about pillow module... Just now I came across pillow module...Now I'm working in anaconda Jupiter.. but don't know how to work in python IDLE
02:19:05 <Miranda> s muthu
02:19:11 <Muthuramalingam> ok
02:19:26 <Muthuramalingam> please continue. 
02:19:50 <Miranda> How to run html files in jupiter?
02:20:16 <shrini1> Don't go with jupyter
02:20:17 <Muthuramalingam> python IDLE is only for beginning.  you can try in jupiter or other IDEs
02:20:34 <shrini1> Just use notepad++ or atom editors
02:20:56 <shrini1> Edit code in editor and run from command prompt
02:21:03 <Miranda> ok shrini.. reason ?
02:21:27 <shrini1> Too many tools add too many complexity
02:21:43 <Miranda> Ok shrini..
02:21:54 <shrini1> See here, you asked how to run HTML files in jupyter?
02:22:05 <Miranda> S
02:22:22 <Muthuramalingam> shrini1 yes, this is good point.  When we start using tools, we slowly shift from our project and will move about learning the tool
02:22:22 <shrini1> We can avoid these kind of new issues, if you use simple editor
02:22:38 <Miranda> Ok muthu..
02:23:21 <shrini1> Tech questions later
02:23:31 <shrini1> Let us finish the status updates first

03:04:25 <Gokul> Muthu & Shrini : one quick doubt or suggestion .. why cant we have email group for our folks ..so instead of sharing the error message we can share to the email group so it will be easy for future reference before checking any issues in google, we can check in our email box also .. 
03:05:58 <Janet> Thanks 
03:05:59 <Muthuramalingam> Gokul - Yes, thats the plan.  If they face any issue, they can send mail to ChennaiPy Mailing list.  Thus, we could get answer from python experts easily.  
03:06:47 <Gokul> Because seeing doubts either in screenshot or attachment is not clear .. or if we we missed 3 to 4 days of chats .. we want to go top to the Telegram to see what happned last 4 days .. 
03:06:59 <Gokul> Ohhh okay okay .. then fine .. thanks
