02:12:43 <Muthuramalingam> Are you cropping images of all users and storing in same size?  
02:13:32 <Janet> Yes I need to try in this way only

02:25:47 <Muthuramalingam> for all - in stand up call meetings - it is ok to say "Yesterday I did not do anything as I was involved in other things".  
02:26:13 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil - your updates
02:27:03 <Tamil> yestesday I completed my project upload files using internetarchive
02:27:16 <Tamil> today make a demo video for my project.
02:27:30 <Tamil> blog: https://tamilvelanpython.wordpress.com/2020/06/25/upload-file-using-internetarchive/
02:27:40 <Tamil> Github: https://gist.github.com/tamilvelan7/9ecc404c994287c0a5d38876376e8731
02:28:29 <Tamil> And what will do next?
02:29:27 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil - dont hard code your file location like uploadfile=upload('tamilvelanpython','C://Users/ELCOT/Downloads/internetarchive.pdf')
02:30:11 <shrini1> Tamil: did you download all the PDF files from that site using code?
02:30:33 <Tamil> yes
02:31:02 <Tamil> merge the all program!
02:31:11 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil store all the PDF locations in a text file.  Open that file.  Read each PDF location and pass that to uploadfile.  
02:31:50 <Tamil> ok
02:33:00 <Tamil> today i will try.
02:34:23 <Muthuramalingam> ok, any other questions?
02:35:11 <Muthuramalingam> For all - Have your 'About Us' page in blog properly.  Think about yourself.  Give a good self intro. there
02:35:34 <Janet> Ok
02:36:20 <shrini1> Janet: make a command line version of your tool first
02:36:29 <shrini1> Let us make it as web ui later
02:36:56 <Janet> OK shrini
02:37:03 <shrini1> Make a config file as config.yaml
02:37:53 <Janet> I will start working on command line version
02:38:04 <shrini1> In that file, give variables and values like text to add, images resolution, images folder path, flicker api, flicker album name etc
02:38:18 <shrini1> Then parse that file and run all the process
02:38:38 <shrini1> Command line applications are really powerful in realtime
02:38:38 <miranda> Command line version means without flask or django shrini?
02:38:43 <shrini1> Yes
02:38:55 <shrini1> In works as a command
02:39:21 <shrini1> Once CLI version is done, we can make it as a web application
02:39:51 <Muthuramalingam> shrini1 you mixed both Miranda and Janet codings.  Anyways, Janet - if you are not working on flickr right now, you can skip that part alone in your file. 
02:40:18 <shrini1> Imagine we have to use your application for 1000 0 images
02:40:30 <shrini1> Oh sorry if I mixed
02:40:59 <Muthuramalingam> no issues, both their projects are closed aligned.  
02:41:02 <Janet> No issues 
02:41:06 <shrini1> My above suggestion is for the image resize, add label, upload to flickr project
02:41:10 <Muthuramalingam> *closely
02:42:01 <Muthuramalingam> Tamil has changed his wordpress favicon .  Others can also try during free time.  
02:42:51 <miranda> ok muthu
02:43:14 <miranda> ok shrini
02:44:41 <Muthuramalingam> other questions if any

02:59:08 <shrini> just add important things hapened on that day
02:59:28 <shrini> this will improve your writing skills
02:59:50 <shrini> if you use computer to write diary, use plantext file
03:00:09 <shrini> dont use any fancy applications like word processor
03:00:25 <shrini> learn markdown markup 
03:00:37 <shrini> use markdown to setup the headings and sub headings
03:00:58 <shrini> use only text editor like emacs or notepad++
03:01:23 <shrini> use one single text file, to write all your diary entries
03:01:35 <shrini> this will be a great asset over years
