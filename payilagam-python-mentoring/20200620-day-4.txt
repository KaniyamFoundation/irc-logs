02:50:42 <Muthuramalingam> shrini1 - what is the difference between gist.github.com and github.com - which link we should give. 
02:51:06 <shrini> github.com is to host all our entire git repositories
02:51:32 <shrini> gist is to store one program snippet and share it on blogposts quickly
02:51:53 <shrini> it blogs, indentation is very tough. we have to indent manually for all lines
02:51:56 <shrini> it is too tough
02:52:05 <shrini> just paste in gist.github.com 
02:52:15 <shrini> it knows all languages and will keep the indentations
02:52:22 <shrini> then paste the links in blogposts
