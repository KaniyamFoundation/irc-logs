02:09:42 <Muthuramalingam> In blog, instead of screenshot of the programs - you can use gist.github.com and share the code
02:09:53 <Muthuramalingam> thus Search Engines can easily find your blog
02:09:59 <karpagam> ok sure
02:10:24 <Miranda> Yesterday : uploaded the code to rotate an image,resized the image.

02:53:25 <shrini1> Give a unique Id to the filename and store
02:53:42 <shrini1> To avoid issues by same filename upload multiple times
02:53:46 <shrini1> For all
02:54:09 <karpagam> my program is check file and  count the file also
02:54:15 <karpagam> can you give me any ideas what shall i do next in my project.
02:54:29 <shrini1> Prepare the status in below format in a text file before the meet.    Yesterday status, today's plan, git & blog links, any obstacles
02:54:42 <shrini1> And copy/paste here quickly
02:54:56 <shrini1> So that we can save time have some discussions
02:55:08 <Janet> Yes I agree
02:55:18 <Muthuramalingam> true
02:55:35 <Miranda> S , true shrini
02:55:50 <shrini1> karpagam: so if I put a copy of a file somewhere on any folder, can your program find it and tell
02:56:09 <shrini1> And list the original filename, path
02:56:27 <shrini1> And duplicate file(s) name and path
02:56:29 <shrini1> ?
02:56:54 <karpagam> yes but it will work only specific path like  c drive, d drive
02:57:28 <shrini1> That's fine
02:57:58 <shrini1> Can you show demo ?
02:58:16 <shrini1> Record as screencast and upload in youtube
02:58:22 <karpagam> yes ofcourse
02:58:29 <shrini1> Do a code walkthrough too
02:58:39 <Muthuramalingam> For all - please plan for a demo of your projects
02:58:50 <Janet> OK. Sure
02:58:56 <karpagam> sure .
02:59:03 <Miranda> Sure muthu
02:59:15 <sakthi> ok
02:59:52 <shrini1> Can anyone post today's meeting minutes?
03:00:04 <Janet> I will do
03:00:11 <shrini1> OK Janet 
03:00:39 <Muthuramalingam> if all topics are done, thank you all. 
03:00:58 <Janet> Thank you all
03:01:28 <jasonbraganza> Have a lovely day, folks!
03:01:59 <shrini> Offtopic discussions now
03:02:16 <Miranda> Ok Shrini..
03:02:26 <shrini> if you need good oreganizer for all your notes, todo, projects
03:02:37 <shrini> check emacs editor and orgmode
03:02:54 <shrini> it is helping me to do more things
03:03:06 <shrini> and better in organizing things
03:03:50 <shrini> if project management are new, just list down your todo list for the day in paper/pen or a text file daily
03:04:08 <shrini> mark as done or strike that line, once a task is done
03:04:31 <Muthuramalingam> yes, preparing a todo list - will help me to be more productive 
03:04:37 <shrini> prioritize the tasks and do only the top 3 priorities at first
03:05:01 <shrini> use plain text files for all the todo items
03:05:18 <shrini> you can learn emacs and orgmode slowly
03:05:28 <shrini> but use any file editor now to make the todo items
03:05:36 <shrini> we can have emacs sessions later
03:05:47 <shrini> I hope emacs is available for windows too
03:06:00 <shrini> anyone can use it
03:06:10 <karpagam> Emacs for Linux is a customizable text editor 
03:06:18 <Janet> OK shrini we will try
03:06:32 <Muthuramalingam> shrini - i have issues in tamil typing in my linux mint machine. 
03:06:46 <Muthuramalingam> let me know your free time to fix that
03:06:48 <shrini> Emacs has weird keyboard shortcuts, dont get confused of them
03:06:54 <shrini> learn it very slowly
03:06:58 <shrini> one commadn at a time
03:07:08 <shrini> it may take few weeks to learn it
03:07:23 <jasonbraganza> yes it is, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html
03:07:23 <karpagam> (y) 
03:07:32 <shrini> but once learnt, will be  a lifetime tool to do all the things
03:07:51 <shrini> jumping to next topic
03:07:55 <shrini> Muthuramalingam: what is the issue?
03:08:13 <shrini> give more details on the issue
03:08:37 <shrini> read "how to ask smart questions" blog by ESR
03:08:45 <Muthuramalingam> sure
03:08:51 <shrini> our friends have read it abd blogged the notes
03:09:04 <Muthuramalingam> yes, I do
03:09:53 <shrini> what is the issue in typing?
03:09:55 <Muthuramalingam> I have ibus installed in linux mint machine, though it is not typing tamil there
03:10:12 <shrini> did you select the tamil keyboard layout?
03:10:17 <Muthuramalingam> I can choose tamil as a choice but still I couldnt get 
03:10:20 <shrini> like tamil99 or phonetic?
03:10:29 <Muthuramalingam> I tried for phonetic
03:10:35 <Muthuramalingam> tamil99 - i should learn
03:10:56 <Miranda> I will leave now..I have a webinar...Thank you Muthu and Shrini..

03:18:14 <Tamil1> for other website is working well 
03:19:08 <shrini> Tamil1: I think there is no direct link to download
03:19:26 <shrini> you have to automate the web browsing using python
03:19:27 <Tamil1> yes

03:19:40 <shrini> click each book link
03:19:42 <shrini> goto next page

03:21:11 <shrini1> Explore the Python library beautifulsoup
03:21:46 <shrini1> and mechanize
03:21:59 <Tamil1> ok thanks 
03:22:08 <shrini1> They both will help you automate all browsing
03:24:02 <Tamil1> to get download link manually?
03:24:20 <Tamil1> or beautifulsoup module
03:24:41 <shrini1> Don't download manually
