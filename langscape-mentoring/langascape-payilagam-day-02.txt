11:13:05	shrini	Ilango: ah. then thats ok

11:13:35	shrini	then its fine. just check the result and display
11:13:38	shrini	as it is
11:13:48	shrini	then move to any other project
11:14:39	Ilango	result of PNR status? But only on knowing a real PNR I get result. Pls clarify
11:15:09	shrini	You will get a error message like "invalid PNR" or similar
