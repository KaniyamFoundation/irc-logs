10:49:41	Ilango	Tried with bs4 for pnr scraping after manually entering PNR in makemytrip.com
10:49:48	Ilango	because indianrail is using captcha. could not do in that. Tried requests post and get in form .
10:49:57	Ilango	makemytrip.com result string in soup is giving 'None'. Checking other websites with robots.txt if any webs
10:49:58	shrini	nice
10:50:07	Ilango	git link: https://github.com/ilangovenac/PNR-status-Webscrap/blob/master/PNR_check_bs4.py
10:50:22	shrini	ok
10:50:45	shrini	I think, this is enough with this project. As we dont have much traveling people to get a PNR, 
10:50:54	shrini	this is not right time to proceed further
10:51:03	shrini	Ilango: pick up some other idea
10:51:20	seelan	Hi Shrini can i leave now,? i will catch up with notes.

11:15:51	shrini	will ask to add all your blogs here - http://planet.payilagam.com/

11:16:27	shrini	The blogs have RSS feed, to provide the content to any third party RSS reader

11:17:49	shrini	so keep writing daily, even after the classes are over
11:18:05	shrini	it will help you to reach heights
11:18:33	shrini	I am writing here http://goinggnu.wordpress.com for 15 years
11:18:45	shrini	it became my visiting card, most of the times
11:18:59	shrini	All the jobs I got through writing there only
11:19:34	shrini	I add the blog URL in my resume, the company tech teams read them and knew who i am
11:19:34	Thulasi_prabha	Great work shrini
11:19:56	shrini	and the interviews were casual discussions, as they already know who i am via my blog
11:20:16	shrini	Thats why asking you all to write more and regularly
11:20:31	shrini	in few years, it will become a habit and a great asset
11:21:04	shrini	Next is to learn about Free/Open software
11:21:05	shrini	http://www.kaniyam.com/podcast/introduction-to-freesoftware-by-amachu/
11:21:11	shrini	hear this podcast
11:21:20	shrini	ask me for any queries
11:22:09	shrini	thats all for today
11:22:23	shrini	is anybody have any quesions?
11:23:00	stephenrajy	your works are so inspiring ill try to blog daily but it takes more time than coding.
11:23:15	shrini	will tell one more success story on my blog, tomorrow
11:23:24	shrini	yes, writing takes time
11:23:29	<--	Thulasi_prabha (9d330ef0@157.51.14.240) has quit (Quit: Connection closed)
11:23:33	shrini	code or content
11:23:48	shrini	both take time
11:24:07	shrini	dont worry much on the quality, grammer mistake on initial days
11:24:16	shrini	the more you write, it will become good
11:24:32	stephenrajy	for myself coding is faster than explaining content
11:24:46	shrini	to embed any code on the blog, put in gist.github.com and paste the url on the blog post
11:24:56	shrini	it will bring the code to the blog post
11:25:01	stephenrajy	ok
11:25:22	shrini	Fine, have to leave now
11:25:27	shrini	see you all tomorrow
