shrini	Next Ilango 
shrini	Ilango: share your updates
Ilango	Tried with bs4 for pnr scraping after manually entering PNR in makemytrip.com
Ilango	because indianrail is using captcha. could not do in that. Tried requests post and get in form .
Ilango	makemytrip.com result string in soup is giving 'None'. Checking other websites with robots.txt if any webs
shrini	nice
Ilango	git link: https://github.com/ilangovenac/PNR-status-Webscrap/blob/master/PNR_check_bs4.py
shrini	ok
shrini	I think, this is enough with this project. As we dont have much traveling people to get a PNR, 
shrini	this is not right time to proceed further
shrini	Ilango: pick up some other idea
seelan	Hi Shrini can i leave now,? i will catch up with notes.
Ilango	ok. thanks. even i felt very much stuck for last few days.
shrini	sure seelan 
shrini	will share the chatlogs on telegram
shrini	bye seelan 
shrini	thanks Ilango 
shrini	I should have thought this before. sorry. my bad
Ganesh	Hi I have chosen cost estimator for my project.
shrini	still, it is a good exercise to explore bs4
shrini	Ganesh: hi
Ilango	it was good experience only
shrini	explain about your project idea and progress

shrini	so keep writing daily, even after the classes are over
shrini	it will help you to reach heights
shrini	I am writing here http://goinggnu.wordpress.com for 15 years
shrini	it became my visiting card, most of the times
shrini	All the jobs I got through writing there only
shrini	I add the blog URL in my resume, the company tech teams read them and knew who i am
Thulasi_prabha	Great work shrini
shrini	and the interviews were casual discussions, as they already know who i am via my blog
shrini	Thats why asking you all to write more and regularly
shrini	in few years, it will become a habit and a great asset
shrini	Next is to learn about Free/Open software
shrini	http://www.kaniyam.com/podcast/introduction-to-freesoftware-by-amachu/
shrini	hear this podcast
shrini	ask me for any queries
shrini	thats all for today
shrini	is anybody have any quesions?
stephenrajy	your works are so inspiring ill try to blog daily but it takes more time than coding.
shrini	will tell one more success story on my blog, tomorrow
shrini	yes, writing takes time
<--	Thulasi_prabha (9d330ef0@157.51.14.240) has quit (Quit: Connection closed)
shrini	code or content
shrini	both take time
shrini	dont worry much on the quality, grammer mistake on initial days
shrini	the more you write, it will become good
stephenrajy	for myself coding is faster than explaining content
shrini	to embed any code on the blog, put in gist.github.com and paste the url on the blog post
shrini	it will bring the code to the blog post
stephenrajy	ok
shrini	Fine, have to leave now
shrini	see you all tomorrow
shrini	bye
stephenrajy	thanks for the motivation shrini bro
rajarajan	thank you
